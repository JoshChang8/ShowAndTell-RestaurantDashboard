## Restaurant Dashboard Components 

The application has been organized into modular components for better readability and maintenance:

### 1. Data Loading and Preparation
- Organizes diner reservations into buckets of data based on date range so dashboard can show 10-20 reservations at a time for further analysis and general overview 
- Create tables to display reservation data of diners 
   -  Master Table, Dietary Restrictions Table, Special Occasions Table
-  Fine-dining-dataset.json is augmented to add more detail upon each diner reservation
- The following fields are included:
   - is_VIP: boolean if customer is VIP 
   - dietary_information: dietary restrictions or preferences 
   - special_occasion: ie) anniversary, birthday, proposal, business meeting 
   - other_info: usually additional information regarding special occasion or any additional things that customer needs 
   - returning_customer: customers last experience at restaurant

### 2. UI Components 
- **Main Dashboard Structure**
   - Title, description, Smart Inbox sidebar, statistics section, 3 tables of data 
- **Interactive Components**
   - Date Range Selections, Expandable Tables Smart Inbox, Morning Huddle Transcription

### 3. AI Integrations 
- **Diner Follow-Up Analysis**
   - Takes reservation information along with email information of all diners in date bucket and leverages LLM to determine which customers need a follow up with server ie) photography permissions or addition to party size
   - Results are stored in Smart Inbox on sidebar, inspiration from S&T demo
- **Morning Huddle Audio Analysis**
   - User uploads audio file of morning huddle, then transcripted to text using OpenAIâ€™s whisper model
   - Transcription sent to Cohere LLM which summarizes meeting and extracts action items for servers to complete 

### 4. Performance Optimizations 
- **Caching**: smart inbox results caches in session state to avoid redundant API calls ie) one you select a bucket and smart inbox is generated, if you switch and go back, results are still saved, unless you click the analyze button
- **Parallel Processing**: analyze diner bucket data in smart inbox using joblib to process tasks faster

## Features

- **Reservation Management**: View and filter reservations by date range
- **Smart Inbox**: AI-powered follow-up recommendations
- **Audio Transcription**: Convert morning huddle recordings to text
- **Data Analysis**: Statistics and visualizations for each date bucket
- **Specialized Views**: Dietary restrictions and special occasions tables
